# LGI Types

This is a collection of types for GLib and Gio through [LGI](https://github.com/lgi-devs/lgi).

> LGI is gobject-introspection based dynamic Lua binding to GObject based libraries. It allows using GObject-based libraries directly from Lua.

None of the types are complete, but they are great for getting started with LGI.
